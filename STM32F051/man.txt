NAME
	adc

DESCRIPTION
	adc is the systems method for using the analogue to digital converter provided by the host microcontroller.
	This can be used to poll one or multiple pins in one shot or continuous mode. Output is selectable based on 
	locations enabled. adc always prints system time.

USAGE
	adc -c -12345   >output.txt 	collects data from pins 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, continuously writing to output.txt (sd card must be present) 
	adc -o -4 			reads pin 4 and prints to console

NAME
	dac

DESCRIPTION
	dac is the console command for setting up the digital to analogue converter on. This method can only set one pin at a time,
	and is restricted to the number of timers enabled
USAGE
	dac -4  1.79			creates a voltage of 1.76 on pin 4

NAME
	pwm

DESCRIPTION
	pwm is the console command for setting up pwm on a pin.  This method is restricted to the timers and pins available on
	the microcontroller. The pin, frequency, and duty cycle must be specified
USAGE
	pwm -3 -1.5 -72 	pin 3 toggled at 1.5 MHz with a 72% duty cycle

NAME
	date

DESCRIPTION	
	date is a console command which can be used to read or set current systemtime used by the microcontroller. All returned 
	I/O or adc values are stamped with this time, unless a flag has been set to inore this using -s(ilence) option

USAGE
	date			return current date 2014.03.05.12.05.57.69
	date -s 		silences datestamp
	date 2042.02.29.23.59

NAME
	uart
DESCRIPTION
	uart is the console command for enabling uart passthough mode.  Frequency is selectable upto max handled by bluetooth
	during this mode, the console is not accessible, except by using a break character.  By default this character is ~, but can be
	selected as desired.
USAGE
	uart -38400 -8N1
